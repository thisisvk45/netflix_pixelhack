# Netflix India - Pixel-Perfect Frontend Clone with Mood-Based Discovery  
**A submission for the Pixel Plus Hackathon 2025**

---

## üßæ Overview

This project is part of my submission for the **Pixel Plus Hackathon 2025**. The goal was to replicate a real-world website with pixel-level precision and enhance it with original, functional features that improve the overall user experience.

I chose to build a **Netflix India** front-end clone using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript** ‚Äî with **no frameworks, no backend**, and a fully responsive layout.

The site includes advanced features such as **mood-based recommendations**, **voice input**, **weather-aware suggestions**, and a **simulated co-watch experience**, all built from scratch and fully functional.
