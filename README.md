# Netflix India - Pixel-Perfect Frontend Clone with Mood-Based Discovery  
**A submission for the Pixel Plus Hackathon 2025**

---

## 🧾 Overview

This project is part of my submission for the **Pixel Plus Hackathon 2025**. The objective was to replicate an existing website with pixel-perfect accuracy and improve it by adding original, functional, and user-focused enhancements.

I chose to clone **Netflix India**, building everything from scratch using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**—without any frameworks or backend services.

The final product includes innovative features like **mood-based recommendations**, **voice input**, **story customization**, **weather-aware prompts**, and a **simulated co-watching experience**, all integrated directly into the site’s header for seamless access.
